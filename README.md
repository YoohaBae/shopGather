# SBUHacks 2022: ShopGather

### Team name: WeByte
Yooha Bae, Yool Bi Lee, Ha-Eun Park

### Challenges we are responding to 
People who live in sharehouses buy groceries or goods together to save on shipping costs and garbage such as boxes and plastic bags used when distributing them. If they pay all at once, people often get confused and spend a lot of time organizing how much they have to pay. Also, people can make mistakes in calculating taxes. These steps are inconvenient processes they have to face constantly.

### How our project addresses the challenge
List items bought based on receipts. After putting in the names or nicknames of the people who purchased it together, each person checks the items they purchased. Then, it automatically calculates and shows the amount of money for each item and the tax for the item.

### Technologies 
React JS, Python, MUI

### What we learned
We recalled React JS usually and thought about some algorithm to get some numbers(price). 

### Problems and Solution: 
We are having difficulty with the algorithm for calculating the price of items that users buy with others. It was difficult to implement an algorithm that finds out how many people bought it together and calculates the price of the corresponding item based on it.

### Proud
Clean and straightforward UI design. Our motto of the design is “simple is the best.”
